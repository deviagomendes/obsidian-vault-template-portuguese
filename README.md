## 📑 Note Properties Structure

Every note in the system uses these standard properties in the YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
aliases: [Alternative Names]
tags:
  - type/study
  - context/academic
  - theme/algorithms
  - status/in-progress
date: 2024-01-01
last_updated: 2024-01-10
---
```

### Example Note Structure

[Check here](02%20-%20Knowledge/Computer/Algorithm_complexity.md)

## 🏷️ Tagging System
Tags are implemented within the properties system as shown in the examples above. Check [tag guide](99%20-%20Meta/System/Guide%20to%20Tags%20and%20Links%20-%20Note%20Organization%20in%20Obsidian.md) for a complete list.

### 1. Type Tags
Identify the nature of the note:
```
#type/task       → Tasks
#type/project    → Projects
#type/daily      → Daily notes
#type/study      → Study material
#type/idea       → Insights
#type/reflection → Reflections
#type/habits     → Routines and habits
```

### 2. Context Tags
Indicate the note's environment:
```
#context/studies     → Learning
#context/work        → Professional
#context/personal    → Personal development
#context/academic    → University
#context/hobbies     → Personal interests
```

### 3. Theme Tags
Organize by knowledge area:
```
Computing:
#theme/cybersecurity → Security
#theme/dev           → Development
#theme/os            → Operating systems
#theme/algorithms    → Algorithms and structures
#theme/AI            → Artificial intelligence

...and much more (see complete tag guide)
```

### 4. Metadata Tags
Control status and priority:
```
#status/[completed|in-progress|planning|idea]
#priority/[high|medium|low]
#review/[pending|completed|needed]
```

### Tag Usage Best Practices

#### Required Minimum Tags
To maintain consistency and facilitate search, each note should include at minimum in its properties:
1. One type tag (`#type/...`)
2. One context tag (`#context/...`)
3. One theme tag (`#theme/...`)
4. One status/priority tag when applicable

## 🔗 Linking System

### Link Types
1. **Direct Links**: `[[Note Name]]`
2. **Alias Links**: `[[Note Name|Displayed Text]]`
3. **Section Links**: `[[Note Name#Section]]`

### Recommended Practices
- Create meaningful connections
- Use MOCs (Maps of Content) to organize themes
- Leverage backlinks to discover relationships
- Build flexible hierarchies through links

## 📚 Integrated Methods

The system incorporates practices from:
- **Zettelkasten**: Interconnected atomic notes
- **PARA**: Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives
- **Building a Second Brain**: Knowledge capture and organization
- **GTD**: Getting Things Done for task management
- **Feynman Technique**: Teaching to learn
- **Interrogative Elaboration**: Question-based learning
- **Cornell Method**: Systematic note-taking and review
